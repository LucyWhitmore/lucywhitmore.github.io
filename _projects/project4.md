title: Youth Perspectives on Brain Maturation
description: What do adolescents think about how we measure maturation?
---

In order to understand how adolescents interpret current research on maturation and brain maturity, I conducted a qualitative study with members of a local Youth Action Council. The goal of this project was to 1) see what adolescents think about a new metric purported to assess brain maturation and 2) understand the kinds of metrics that adolescents think reflect maturation.

This poster was presented at the 2023 Society for Research on Adolescence conference.
